# Vehicle Longitudinal Lap Simulation

A MATLAB & Simulink based longitudinal vehicle dynamics simulation with integrated brake control, automatic gearbox logic (Stateflow), aerodynamic drag modeling, and lap time evaluation.

This project simulates a vehicle completing a full lap on a parameterized track while respecting speed limits, gear shift logic, braking constraints, and powertrain torque characteristics.
